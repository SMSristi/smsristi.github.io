I’m excited to share that I had the honor of presenting my **undergraduate thesis work**—further refined as a peer-reviewed conference paper—at the  
11th IEEE International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Machine Learning Applications  
July 21-24, 2025 | Tucson, Arizona. 🖥️🌐

After completing my undergraduate thesis, I enhanced the work and submitted it to BigDataService 2025, where it was accepted and featured in the conference program.  
This global event brought together leading minds in **Big Data, ML, AI, Cloud Services, and Data Engineering**. Presenting my research to such an international audience was an incredibly valuable experience that led to thought-provoking discussions and expert feedback.
  
Sincere thanks to the organizing committee, session chairs, and fellow presenters for making this a truly engaging and inspiring conference!

I look forward to future opportunities to share, learn, and collaborate in the global AI & data science community. 🚀
