I’m proud to share my experience as an **Industrial Attachment Intern** at [Synesis IT, Dhaka](https://synesisit.com/) during October 2023 as part of my undergraduate academic program.

During my internship, I received hands-on training and mentorship in:
- Microservices architecture
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) patterns
- RESTful API development
- JWT authentication and security best practices
- Effective teamwork and cross-functional collaboration
- Professional project management in a real-world industrial environment

This intensive experience deepened my practical knowledge of backend development, cloud services, and software engineering while building industrial-grade solutions.  
Grateful to my mentors, team members, and the Synesis IT staff for the guidance, support, and inspiration!

I look forward to applying these skills to new challenges—and continuing to learn in fast-moving tech environments.
